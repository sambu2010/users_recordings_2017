## Data Engineer Take-Home Assignment for AllTrails

AllTrails is a freemium consumer subscription app and wants to better understand what factors contribute to revenue growth. One assumption of the company is that encouraging users to record activities (hikes, bike-rides, etc.) soon after their first signup could positively impact Pro subscription rates. Therefore, the company would like you to help the analysts find insights around the relationship between when users sign-up and when they complete their first GPS recording. To aid the data analysts in this task, your job is to write a batch-processing job to create a single clean, structured dataset that can be more-easily manipulated to help them find the data they need.
